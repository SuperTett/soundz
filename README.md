# Soundz
Soundz is the temporary name for a website project. This website will offer a service of downloadable
audio files determined to be used in creations such has film, videos, games and any other media in need of
soundbytes or samples.

##Products
The main products we are thinking of offering would be sound effects (SFX) and music compositions.
We are currently thinking of offering three tiers of products.
- Basic and free tracks. These would be the most simple, short, and
effortless productions to offer.
- Premium Tracks. These would be paid tracks. Songs with better production value, SFXs that took
more production time and material. We are also thinking about having different pricings on those tracks
with multiple levels (i.e bronze, silver, gold, etc).
- Commissions. This tier would be the most expensive one. It would basically be a commission by the costumer
for his project. This might be exclusive for musical production, but the idea to incorporate SFX in those commission
is not a closed option.
